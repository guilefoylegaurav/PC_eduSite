              In the words and wisdom of the intellectual, Chanakya, a King is
              respected only in his kingdom, while the scholastic prowess of an
              astute scholar is revered everywhere. We, Pragati Classes,
              subscribe to this school of very school of thought. The youth of
              the Nation are the children of immortal bliss, and have the
              potential to change the world in ways unimaginable, given the
              nurturing and mentoring that they need and deserve – and
              incidentally, that they lack. Innumerable are the promising young
              minds who ardently desire to study ,but are destitute, and lack
              the finances and means to send them to centres of learning.

              We all know that Kota, Rajasthan is known as the engineer and MBBS
              producing factory in India. But why to go Kota when you have best
              coaching experience here itself in your own town? Our notes and
              study material are well designed to give you complete experience
              of Competitive exams like NEET, JEE, CEE and what not? For the
              betterment of the students we have designed our modules as per top
              coaching institutes of India(particularly Kota). We have in fact
              spent a lot regarding this matter. So, there’s nothing to worry
              regarding the study materials, they are designed taking reference
              from the modules of Allen-Resonance-Cengage(The top Coaching
              institutes). We also have mentorship plan that is, 3 student per
              mentor. Thus ensuring that each student gets equal importance and
              gets a better understanding of each topics. JEE ,NEET all the
              national level exams are conducted in CBT mode .But most of the
              coaching institutes, even the top ones (let it be in Barak Valley
              or any other part of India), prefers pen-paper mode, so students
              generally face problems and thus commits blunder mistakes during
              the most crucial day of their life and so score sometimes low on
              the very day of exam. So in order to avoid this situations we will
              provide our students with CBT exam mode(Computer based mode). We
              have a number of cells, where more than 20 management staffs are
              working day and night for the classes such as exam control cell,
              software maintenance cell, result declaration cell, web
              development and management cell, editorial and innovation cell and
              most importantly the students welfare development cell. The
              students welfare development cell will not only look after the
              academic issues of the student but will guide the students to
              tackle problems of their day to day life so that they can stick to
              their goals and achieve success.
