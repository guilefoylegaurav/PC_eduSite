          Online learning is a very effective tool in this present era and it
          provides a way by which without wasting much time students could
          interact and cover much broader concepts easily. Here in Pragati
          classes, we have a very flexible approach to handle our students.
          Separate corners for each subject on which video lectures are
          uploaded. Various sessions and doubt clearing sessions are organized
          on video calling or on other digital platform so that student remain
          involved in continuous evaluation and learning. We have a separate
          website through which they can access all those things which are
          necessary for them. Overall online learning is a boon in present era
          and specially in this corona pandemic when most of the students are
          sitting idle.

          Maximum facilities of the centre are students themselves . These
          students have recently cleared their board exams and Entrance so under
          their guidance the students will get to know all the concepts clearly
          and they can give them more realistic view of board exams as well as
          JEE & NEET like exams which they might not get from certified
          teachers.The mode of communication is easy and simple and all the
          students will be guided individually. They will be given the detailed
          lectures on all the topics and also the preparation of JEE/NEET will
          be done according to the choice of the student.Each student gets a
          personal mentor.

          Many students & Parents have recommend Pragati Classes. Pragati
          classes is an institution of the students, by the students and for the
          students. So this line basically clears how we are different from
          others. The teachers are students and this institution is an approach
          from all those students who have faced many difficulties in the recent
          times. They have raw knowledge of all the problems that a student
          feels and they are eager to solve it for the others. They are
          providing a helping hand without thinking for high benefits for
          themselves. They are just searching for a medium to share their
          knowledge.

          Any story that completely describes Pragati Classes ?Lets see what our
          family members says.

          It's well known that only a lion can guide you to enter a den. So, in
          the case of the present scenario as well our teachers can very well
          act as the lion! Firstly, in this hour of crisis and pandemic, very
          less , in some areas even none of the coaching classes are providing
          online classes to the students which is creating a huge gap between
          academics and the students. So, Pragati Classes with its well groomed
          strategy of online classes can act as a bridge to combine these two
          entities again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, if we see about the demographics of the state, leaving
          behind some developed cities, none of the other districts have proper
          coaching classes who can really teach you the dynamics of the game
          called JEE/NEET. And , with our online platform, we are breaking the
          shackles of geographical barriers and reaching out to anyone and
          everyone who is eager to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, we , the students of NIT/IIT/Govt. Medical colleges best know
          the recent trend and pattern of how the competitive exam papers are
          set. We can incorporate new techniques to make students learn a
          concept easily rather than mugging it up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not the least, I don't think that any serious/proper coaching
          prevailing in the state can offer so much of facilities to student at
          the price which are offering. The fee structure is highly reasonable
          and that will help us to reach out to the less privileged kids who
          tend to dream, but the conventional institutes indirectly break all
          their dreams because of their high and costly courses which isn't
          possible for the ward to pay.
